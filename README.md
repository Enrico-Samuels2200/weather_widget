Install:
--------
In order to use this program, navigate to its' directory via command line.
Once there enter 'npm install', this will install the dependencies and enter
'npm start' to launch the app. Or just enter 'npm install && npm start' to
shorten the steps.

Note:
-----
1) I've made changes to the weather.json file to fit well with the app. I've updated
   the dates in the json file.

2) I wasn't sure what measurement of temperature the temperatures was so I've converted
   it into degrees. Therefor the temperatures appears unrealistic.
